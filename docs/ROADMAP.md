# PlaceholderTitle Roadmap

## Player-to-Player Trading System
- Implement a basic player marketplace where users can list their crafted items for sale to other players, and see other players items to buy

## Player Workbench Sharing
- If you have a great workbench full of powerful tools
  you should be able to grant other players access to your workbench in exchange for a fee. The secure workbench sharing feature allows other players to use your tools to craft on their own items.

## Enhanced persona system
- Right now the only character persona data being tracked is how much money the character has
- Add AI generated passives that get leveled up based on your usage
  of item quirks. For example, if interacting with many "gothic" themed items you might gain a
  "vampire" passive and level it up each time you interact with a "gothic" item.
- Consider player passives for the crafting outcome. (Additional token burden might require faster models)
- Add a mirror / vanity table for player character to inspect their stats and passives.

## Image conditioning
- Rather than having the image generator create a new image from scratch when
  and item's appearance changes, supply the original image as a reference, thereby increasing the similarity between the newly modified item's image and the existing image.

## Basic progression system
- Consider using the persona system to keep track of purchasable upgrades.
- Maybe tool bench starts out with only a few item slots, can purchase upgraded tool benches with more slots and more power?
- Ability to buy another storage chest?
- Ability to upgrade "computer" from old model to a sleek modern laptop that lets you "order" AI generated items from specific themes and categories rather than pulling completely randomly.

## AI Shop System
- Expand the basic "item appraisal" system into a full shop. You should be able to walk through the door at the bottom
  to access your shop. Implement display cases for showcasing items for sale.
- Create an AI guest system that:
  - Generates diverse AI customers with different preferences
  - Enables natural conversation about items
  - Implements a haggling system with realistic price negotiations
  - Provides feedback on item quality and desirability

## Daily Crafting Contests
- Create a contest system with random daily themes. You
  submit a crafted item to the daily contest in exchange for rewards.
- Implement AI judging system that evaluates:
  - Theme adherence
  - Craftsmanship quality
  - Creativity and originality
  - Technical execution
- Develop a playoff system for top performers:
  - Weekly finals for top 100 players
  - Advanced AI judging criteria
  - Prize system for winners
- Add contest history and leaderboards
- Implement contest notifications and reminders

## Fashion Show
- Submit a set of stylish, whacky, or otherwise interesting themed clothing
- AI matches you to another player, and judges your outfit relative to the other
  players outfit, somewhat like Infinity Nikki.
- Range of different AI generated judge personas. You must analyze the set of
  judges and then pick and choose your best items to try to impress them based
  on the judge personas.

## Battle System
- Hire an AI champion, and equip them with your unique crafted
  items as armor or weapons.
- Dispatch your warrior to fight randomly generated AI monsters.
- Equipment will take real damage that needs to be repaired, and
  monster slaying will return interesting loot.
- Potential for PvP battles with other player's AI champions. Both players pick their champion's gear, and the AI simulates the battle results between both champions using the gear to the best of their abilities.
